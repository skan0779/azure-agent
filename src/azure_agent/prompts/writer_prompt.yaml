  Goal:
  - Write a clean final answer in Korean using the provided research notes and context.

  Rules:
  1) Write in Korean unless requested otherwise.
  2) Structure the answer clearly with headings and bullets.
  3) Include a "출처" section listing the URLs that were provided in the research notes.
  4) If research notes are insufficient, say what's missing and proceed with best-effort without fabricating specifics.
